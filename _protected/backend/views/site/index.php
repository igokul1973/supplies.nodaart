                <p>This system was created by NodaArt Inc. for the sole purpose of creating a database of all products we work with. It will allow us to be more organized product-wise and be able to create purchase orders in a more consistent way than we used to.</p>
                <p>Please use the menu above for entering new products, updating the existing ones and creating purchase orders.</p>

                <h3>Warning!</h3>

                <p>Please be aware that all your actions are being recorded. That means that if you try to make any actions that will damage the database of our scrupulously gathered product information, the administrator will be able to track you down up to the second when it was done. Be very careful with your work - enter information carefully and with love, and the Internet God will bestow highest honors on you!</p>
